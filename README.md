# 🚀 Tokio Hyper Playground

Tokio Hyper Playground is an experimental project written in Rust that demonstrates how to build a simple asynchronous HTTP server using **Tokio** and **Hyper**.

The goal is to learn the basics of concurrency-safe, asynchronous programming in Rust by building a small server that responds to local requests.
It's a great personal lab or a starting point for developing web servers and microservices in Rust.

## 🔹 Technologies

- ⚡ **Rust** — a safe, high-performance systems language
- 🔄 **Tokio** — asynchronous runtime for Rust
- 🌐 **Hyper** — fast, low-level HTTP library

## 📌 Features

- Runs a local server at http://127.0.0.1:3000
- Responds with a simple welcome message
- Minimal, easy-to-experiment structure
